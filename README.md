- An example of fetching a dummy route that returns the current date time from our Express server.

## Setup

1. Install packages by running `npm install` in `client/`, `server/` and the root directory.
2. Install nodemon globally to run the server: `sudo npm i -g nodemon`.
3. To develop, run `npm run dev`, which will start the server and client simultaneously. Both should hot reload.
